### 🧿 About Me

- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Explorer** deeply engaged in offensive security, red teaming, and bug bounty methodologies.
- 🧠 I learn by breaking — web apps, protocols, binaries — and build tools to automate it.
- 📚 I love reading RFCs, fuzzing custom payloads, and reverse engineering weird edge cases.
- 🌐 Contributor to open-source offensive security tools (soon... 👨‍💻).
- 📖 Writing my journey publicly via technical blogs, walkthroughs, and writeups.
- 🏴‍☠️ Focused on **real-world attacks** — not textbook checkboxes.
