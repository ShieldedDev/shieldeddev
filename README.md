### 🧠 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong offensive mindset, deeply engaged in:

- 🕸️ Web & API Security Testing (XSS, IDOR, SSRF, CSP Bypass, etc.)
- 🧪 Python automation for reconnaissance, fuzzing, and exploit chaining
- 🐧 Linux internals, networking, and post-exploitation scripting
- 🔍 Reverse engineering and basic binary exploitation
- 🧰 Building open-source tools for ethical hacking and automation

I'm on a mission to make the digital world safer — one exploit, one patch, one line of code at a time.

### 🧠 Current Cybersecurity Focus

- 🔎 Practicing offensive recon & exploitation with Burp Suite, ffuf, SQLMap, and custom Python scripts.
- ⚙️ Automating recon + vuln discovery (subdomain enum, JS file analysis, API fuzzing).
- 🧬 Studying reverse engineering and developing custom payloads (RCE, LFI, etc).
- 🛠️ Building a personal arsenal of tools for pentesting & bug bounty.

---

### 🐞 Bug Bounty Highlights

- Exploiting and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities (IDOR, auth bypass, XSS, SSRF).
- Working with organizations to improve their security posture.
- Focused on high-signal, reproducible reports with working PoCs.

---

### 🚀 Learning & Building Goals

- 🧠 Master **OSCP** and **eCPPTv2** methodologies
- ⚙️ Release open-source tools: recon automation, fuzzers, payload managers
- ✍️ Publish blog writeups & tool walkthroughs on real-world attacks
- 📦 Document every exploit and lesson — publicly and clearly
- 👥 Collaborate with security-minded developers and hackers
